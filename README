=====

Before running "make check" you need to do the following:

* Add a HTTP service principal for the machine you will run "make check" on.
  For example using:
   $ kadmin.local: addprinc -randkey HTTP/<fqdn>

* Store the key in "http.keytab" in the top build directory.
  For example using:
   $ kadmin.local: ktadd -k http.keytab HTTP/<fqdn>

* Obtain and cache a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket with kinit.

* Run "make check"

* The outcome is indicated by make which outputs "*** [check] Error" if an
  error occurred.
